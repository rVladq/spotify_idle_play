# Is set automatically to the last played device's id on script start, and the value gets saved here.
# !If spotify is opened by __main__.py, it won't open fast enough for the script to retrieve the DEVICE_ID!
# If you rely on __main__.py to open spotify (e.g. run at startup), make sure DEVICE_ID is already set, by running the
# script at least once while spotify is already opened.
# !If you want to change DEVICE_ID just restart the script after switching to that device from the app!
